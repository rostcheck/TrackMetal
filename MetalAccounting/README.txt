MetalAccounting is a core library for doing accounting operations on bullion or crpytocurrency.
It understands bullion types (metals), weights and units and interconvertibility, transaction types,
and knows about common storage services. It can track and manage semi-numismatics (by setting the
Item Type, ex "1-oz Silver Eagle"). It can manage cryptocurrencies, by treating all currencies as
metal "Crypto" and setting the ItemType to the specific currency (ex. "BTC").
